# Snake and Ladder Game System Requirements

## Overview
The system should allow multiple players to play the classic game of Snake and Ladder on a virtual board.

## Features
- Supports multiple players (2 or more) to play the game.
- The game follows the standard rules of Snake and Ladder.
- Players take turns rolling a dice and moving their tokens on the board.
- Each player's token starts at position 1 on the board.
- The board consists of cells numbered from 1 to N (N is configurable).
- Special cells include:
    - Snake: If a player lands on a cell with the head of a snake, they move down to the tail of the snake.
    - Ladder: If a player lands on a cell with the bottom of a ladder, they move up to the top of the ladder.
- Players win the game by reaching or surpassing the final cell (N).
- Players can't roll the dice or move their tokens until it's their turn.
- The game ends when one player wins or chooses to quit.
- The system should maintain a log of each player's moves and game events.

## Implementation
- Backend: [JAVA]
- Board Configuration: Configurable number of cells, snakes, and ladders.
- Dice Mechanism: Random number generation for dice rolls.
- Player Tokens: Tokens representing each player's position on the board.

## Additional Notes
- Consider implementing a graphical interface for a better user experience.
- Allow players to customize board settings (e.g., number of cells, positions of snakes and ladders).
- Implement error handling for invalid moves or configurations.
- Provide options for single-player mode against computer-controlled opponents.
