# Problem Statement: Word Square Finder

![Word Square Example](wordsquare.jpg)

## Overview
Given a set of words (without duplicates), the task is to find all word squares that can be built from them.

## Definition
A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read the exact same string, where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns).

## Example
For example, the word sequence ["ball","area","lead","lady"] forms a word square because each word reads the same both horizontally and vertically.
